# Starship Garden

## General Description

The user has a garden area where he can plant and grow alien lifeforms similar to trees. They emit sounds and create an ambient soundscape. Which trees the user plants and how they are nurtured influences their appearance and sound, allowing him to develop his unique "starship garden"

## Best Case

- synthesized sound, per plant and growth state
- procedurally generated visual representation
- continuous plant growth
- plants grow and evolve over time without user interference

## Worst Case

- sampled and filtered sound
- interactions to plant, grow and delete different plant types
  - which interactions?
- plants respond immediately to manipulation
- plants have discrete growth stages, represented by simple, static geometry
  - might include some slight variance
- three different plant types with different sound and visual representation (e.g. bamboo-like strings; tree organs; solid thick bass)

## 2019-04-30

- procedural plants and static plants as different types
- addition to best case: low-complexity procgen plants (e.g. grass, moss, bamboo)

next:

- one tree in all growth states, paper sketch, maybe 3D model
- sound samples for reference
