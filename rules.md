# Game Rules

These are made up rules for the _Starship Garden_. This is work in progress. Everything may change.

- Plant a seed to create a tree as a sapling

- trees age over time
- trees age differently depending on their environment

- you are on an alien planet
- you are in a biosphere of a starship
- the biosphere is an isolated environment
- parameters in the biosphere can be controlled

- you can break the isolation (smash the ceiling panels)
- breaking isolation exposes the trees to the planet environment
- the planet env cannot be controlled

- you can water a tree
- you can cut a tree
- you can fertilize a tree
